Pre-release notes. 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As at 2004-08-25, there was no official release of SphinxTrain by CMU
or by the developers of Sphinx.  Major reason is that SphinxTrain is
in many senses not stable.  

The developers of Sphinx endeavor to release SphinxTrain.  However,
lack of time is always a big constraint for Sphinx's developers.
Before we can get SphinxTrain release, this release notes will used to
record the change made in SphinxTrain correspond to a particular
release of sphinx 3.x.  We also note down the corresponding timestamp.

	SphinxTrian timestamp ???????? 
	correspond to sphinx 3.5 release
	Changes since the last record.
	-The feature extraction libraries of SphinxTrain is now
	EXACTLY the same as sphinx3. 
	-New tools introduced:
	1, mllr_solve, given the EM posterior probabilities of the
	mean and regression class definition. This routine estimate
	regression matrices for each class. 
	2, mllr_transform, given a matrix, this tools applies the
	transformation to the mean vector of the models. 
	-The command line interface for 35 out of 37
	SphinxTrain's tools are unified. Only wave2feat and QUICKCOUNT
	are not yet bind to that rule.
