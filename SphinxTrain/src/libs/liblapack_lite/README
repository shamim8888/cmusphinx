From the FAQ:

LAPACK is a freely-available software package. It is available from
netlib via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. Thus, it can be
included in commercial software packages (and has been). We only ask
that proper credit be given to the authors.

Like all software, it is copyrighted. It is not trademarked, but we do
ask the following:

If you modify the source for these routines we ask that you change the
name of the routine and comment the changes made to the original.

We will gladly answer any questions regarding the software. If a
modification is done, however, it is the responsibility of the person
who modified the routine to provide support.
