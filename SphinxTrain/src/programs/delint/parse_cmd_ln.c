\n\
Deleted interpolation is the final step in creating semi-continuous \n\
models. The output of deleted interpolation are semi-continuous models \n\
in sphinx-3 format. These have to be further converted to sphinx-2 \n\
format, if you want to use the SPHINX-II decoder. \n\
\n\
Deleted interpolation is an iterative process to interpolate between \n\
CD and CI mixture-weights to reduce the effects of overfitting. The \n\
data are divided into two sets, and the data from one set are used to \n\
estimate the optimal interpolation factor between CI and CD models \n\
trained from the other set. Then the two data sets are switched and \n\
this procedure is repeated using the last estimated interpolation \n\
factor as an initialization for the current step. The switching is \n\
continued until the interpolation factor converges.\n\
\n\
To do this, we need *two* balanced data sets. Instead of the actual\n\
data, however, we use the Bauim-Welch buffers, since the related math\n\
is convenient. we therefore need an *even* number of buffers that can\n\
be grouped into two sets. DI cannot be performed if you train using\n\
only one buffer. At least in the final iteration of the training, you\n\
must perform the training in (at least) two parts. You could also do\n\
this serially as one final iteration of training AFTER BW has\n\
converged, on a non-lsf setup.\n\
\n\
Note here that the norm executable used at the end of every Baum-Welch \n\
iteration also computes models from the buffers, but it does not\n\
require an even number of buffers. BW returns numerator terms and\n\
denominator terms for the final estimation, and norm performs the\n\
actual division. The number of buffers is not important, but you would \n\
need to run norm at the end of EVERY iteration of BW, even if you did\n\
the training in only one part. When you have multiple parts norm sums\n\
up the numerator terms from the various buffers, and the denominator\n\
terms, and then does the division. ";
