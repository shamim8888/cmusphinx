PROGRAMS
--------

bw         : Baum-Welch reestimation 
norm       : Accumulate reestimation sums and normalize mixtures
interp     : Semi-continuous model smoothing
mk_flat	   : Generate initial estimates for mixing weights and transition probs
init_gau   : Initialize single Gaussian models from seg files, 
             word transcripts and dictionary.
inc_comp   : Increment the number of densities per mixture by some N.
  	     N is less than or equal to the existing number of densities
init_mixw  : Initialize a destination set of mixing weights from a source set
mk_state_param_def : Generate mixture density tying definition
bldtree    : Build decision trees
prunetree  : Prune decision trees
tiestate   : Tie states using pruned decision trees

USEFUL TOOLS
-------------
printp    : Print the model parameter file
