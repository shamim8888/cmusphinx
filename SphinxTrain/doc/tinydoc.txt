This is so small it isn't documentation, but
is a reminder about what to do when training

Got to a new directory where you have the space
   mkdir time
   cd time
Set up the directory structure, scripts and config files
   $SPHINXTRAINDIR/scripts_pl/setup_SphinxTrain time
The main config file is put into etc/sphinx_train.cfg

Put you waveform files in wav/

Create the following files
   etc/time.fileids  
       List of file ids for each wav file e.g.
            time0001
            time0002
            ...
   etc/time.phone
       The phones in the phone set
            SIL
            AA
            AE
            ..
   etc/time.transcription
       Word transcription of each file, must end in (FILEID), these
       are probably upper case words, but can include filler words too
           THE TIME IS NOW ... (time0001)
   etc/time.filler
       List of filler words and their pronunciation (using the phones) e.g
           <s> SIL
           </s> SIL
           <sil> SIL
           /NOISE/ +NOISE+

Create a dictionary with (only works for US English)

   bin/make_dict etc/time.transcription

WIll create etc/word.known etc/word.unknown files,. check them
once you are happy, 

   mv etc/word.known etc/time.dic

Make the melcep feature files

   bin/make_feats etc/time.fileids

Now we can start on the basic perl scripts, ther
results will be put in perl_time.html, which you can view as things
progress.  Note the scirpts aren't guaranteed, and problems do occur, 
though often the erro message is actually indicative of the error.

Does do enough checking, but may help
   ./scripts_pl/00.verify/verify_all.pl -cfg etc/sphinx_train.cfg 
Can take several minutes
   ./scripts_pl/01.vector_quantize/slave.VQ.pl -cfg etc/sphinx_train.cfg
Initial BW training
   ./scripts_pl/02.ci_schmm/slave_convg.pl -cfg etc/sphinx_train.cfg 1

   ./scripts_pl/03.makeuntiedmdef/make_untied_mdef.pl -cfg etc/sphinx_train.cfg
   ./scripts_pl/04.cd_schmm_untied/slave_convg.pl -cfg etc/sphinx_train.cfg 1
   ./scripts_pl/05.buildtrees/make_questions.pl -cfg etc/sphinx_train.cfg
   ./scripts_pl/05.buildtrees/slave.treebuilder.pl -cfg etc/sphinx_train.cfg
