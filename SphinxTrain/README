This directory contains the scripts and instructions necessary for
building models for the CMU Sphinx Recogniser.

This distribution is free software, see COPYING for licence.

This distribution now uses GNU autoconf to find out basic information
about your system, and should compile on most Unix and Unix-like
systems.  To build, simply run (:

    ./configure
    make

(Or whatever you call GNU Make).  This should configure everything
automatically, though it may fail if it cannot locate Perl 5 and
Festival on your system.  To fix this, set the PERL and FESTIVAL
environment variables to point to the appropriate binaries.

This work was build over a large number of years at CMU by most of the
people in the Sphinx Group, some code goes back to 1986.  The
most recent work in tidying this up for release includes the following
(at least these are the people who are most likely able to help you).
