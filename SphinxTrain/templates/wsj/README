Wall Street Journal "from scratch" training/testing setup
---------------------------------------------------------

This setup relies on having the WSJ0 and WSJ1 corpora, LDC catalog
numbers LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B (only the Sennheiser microphone speech
is used), in a locally accessible directory.  Since this originally
shipped on a number of CDs, to which you may or may not have access,
you should edit the file etc/wsj_files.cfg to point to specific
subdirectories in the corpus.  You will probably need to merge the
contents of multiple CDs into a single directory.  Case of the
filenames should not be important.

You must have the 'sph2pipe' utility from the LDC on your $PATH. We
are not able to distribute due to license restrictions, so you must
obtain it from:

ftp://ftp.ldc.upenn.edu/pub/ldc/misc_sw/sph2pipe_v2.5.tar.gz

In order for the scripts included here to work, you must have Festival
and the Perl scripts and binaries from cmuclmtk in your $PATH.  If you
don't want to install them systemwide, then you can do it like this
(replacing /path/to/cmuclmtk with the full path to wherever the source
tree for it resides):

export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/cmuclmtk/src:/path/to/cmuclmtk/perl"

or, for those of you who still insist on using csh:

setenv PATH "$PATH:/path/to/cmuclmtk/src:/path/to/cmuclmtk/perl"
