  abstract = {With the growing popularity of corpus-based methods for concatenative
	speech synthesis, a large amount of interest has been placed on borrowing
	techniques from the ASR community. This paper explores the applications
	of buried Markov models (BMM) to speech synthesis. We show that BMMs
	are more efficient than HMMs as a synthesis model, and focus on using
	BMM dependencies for computing splicing costs. We also show how the
	computational complexity of the dynamic search can be significantly
	reduced by constraining the splicing points with a negligible loss
	in synthesis quality},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new text-to-speech synthesis system based on
	HMM which includes dynamic features, i.e., delta and delta-delta
	parameters of speech. The system uses triphone HMMs as the synthesis
	units. The triphone HMMs share less than 2,000 clustered states,
	each of which is modelled by a single Gaussian distribution. For
	a given text to be synthesized, a sentence HMM is constructed by
	concatenating the triphone HMMs. Speech parameters are generated
	from the sentence HMM in such a way that the output probability is
	maximized. The speech signal is synthesized directly from the obtained
	parameters using the mel log spectral approximation (MLSA) filter.
	Without dynamic features, the discontinuity of the generated speech
	spectra causes glitches in the synthesized speech. On the other hand,
	with dynamic features, the synthesized speech becomes quite smooth
	and natural even if the number of clustered states is small},
