Main themes of this thesis (in order):

 * Scalable, adaptive acoustic models for ASR on heterogeneous networks

 * Speech recognition using distributed annotators

 * Generic data structures for efficient speech processing

Plan for research, implementation, writing:

 * Continue work on semi-continuous model compression

 * Implement stuff from Nokia papers for comparison

 * Create semi-continuous models from continuous ones (enhanced SubVQ)

 * Implement unscaled compressed SCHMM for adaptive modeling

   - Decide whether semi-continous models are justified

   - Compare with adaptation on Nokia-style quantized HMMs
