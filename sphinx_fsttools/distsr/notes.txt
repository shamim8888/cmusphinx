Things that are important to stress:

 * Why this is not "Distributed Speech Recognition"
   - Information is extracted at a higher level than just MFCCs
   - The results are immediately useful on the client side
   - The architecture is peer-to-peer
   - The architecture does not assume a reliable, always-on network

 * Why this is relevant to asymmetric multiprocessing
   - Past research has shown that (live-mode) ASR is not
     parallelizable in a symmetric fashion
