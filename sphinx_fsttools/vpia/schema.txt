Schema for the data store
-------------------------

Physical representation of data:

Conversation {
    Utterance[];
    Time;
    Channel;		// i.e. Phone, Microphone, VoIP
}

Utterance {
    Audio;
    Segmentation;	// i.e. text + segmentation info
    Time;
}

Semantic representation of data:

Page {
    Text[] aliases;
    Paragraph[];
    Factoid[];
}

Paragraph {
    Text;
    Factoid[];
}

Factoid {
    Utterance core;
    Utterance[] context;
    Page[] entities;
    Relation;		// i.e. is-a, todo, schedule, etc
}

There's no distinction between pages and entities - any entity that
can enter into a semantic relationship in a factoid has a page by
default.  This is analogous to pages in a wiki - they may not contain
any content but they exist by virtue of being named.  This includes
things that may not be thought of as "entities" in a typical ontology.
For example, in a factoid like:

{I} have a {meeting} with {Alex} at {{11} {AM}} on {{Thursday} {{October} {11th}} {2007}}

everything in braces can be considered an entity, since they all can
concievably have information attached to them.
