These are structured from least complex to most complex.

Quick notes
-----------

The user presses a talk button on the device and speaks
one or two utterances.  For example this could be a reminder of
something that needs to be done later, or a phone number, or some sort
of factoid to be remembered.

Brainstorming
-------------

The user dictates a free-form stream of speech.  This may contain
embedded hints as to topics or pages in which to classify the speech.
The system may provide audible feedback at utterance boundaries.

Recall
------

The user seeks to retrieve a note or factoid, or wishes to replay a
section of dictated text.  The user can use a combination of keyword
search and date/time range search.

 "I'm looking for conversations on speech recognition"
 "What things do I have to do this afternoon"
 "What is my advisor's phone number"
