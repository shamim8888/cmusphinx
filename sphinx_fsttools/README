CMU Sphinx finite-state transducer tools
----------------------------------------

This directory contains tools for creating finite-state transducers
from Sphinx acoustic and language models.  It uses the OpenFst toolkit
(http://www.openfst.org/) for FST operations.

Tools provided here are:

sphinx_am_fst - Convert a Sphinx model definition file to a
	        finite-state transducer mapping senone sequences to
	        phone sequences.

sphinx_dict_fst - Convert a Sphinx pronunciation dictionary to a
		  finite-state transducer mapping phone sequences to
		  words.

sphinx_lm_fst - Convert a language model in ARPA or DMP format to a
	        weighted finite-state acceptor, using negative log
	        probabilities as arc weights.
