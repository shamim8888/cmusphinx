	  notices, with the addition of a README.

	- Give a way to pass raw data into Audio::SPX::Continuous
	  (hooray for undocumented features :P)

0.06 Thu Jan 25 14:15:00 EST 2001 (UNRELEASED)
	- Skipped a version, oh well.
	- Add the sub-directories' test suites to MANIFEST (doh)
	- Fix the calling conventions for uttproc_rawdata() and
	  uttproc_result().
	- Add a testsuite for Speech::Recognizer::SPX itself.
	- Add demos of using Audio::SPX::Continuous with select().
	- Add proper path searching for Sphinx2 libraries in
	  Makefile.PL and use the exported $SPHINXDIR variable for
	  defaults.
	- Fix 'undefined value' warnings in Audio::SPX read functions.
	- Allow the use of hash references for fbs_init().

0.04_99 Wed Dec 13 17:02:59 EST 2000 (UNRELEASED)
	- Split off feature extraction and audio modules, link with
	  necessary libraries
	- Changed name to Speech::Recognizer::SPX to comply with the
	  Sphinx2 license and fit into the CPAN namespace better
	- Add exporter functionality to Speech::Recognizer::SPX, and
	  put together some nice tags of things to export.
	- The only thing missing before this can be released is
	  documentation and a test suite, I think.
