uses of the severla versions of Sphinx. These may be used as
guidelines, but keep in mind that there is no definite answer.

<h3>PocketSphinx</h3>

<p>
PocketSphinx is CMU's fastest speech recognition system. It uses Hidden
Markov Models (HMM) with semi-continuous output probability density
functions (PDF). Even though it is not as accurate as Sphinx-3 or
Sphinx-4, it runs at real time, and therefore it is a good choice for
live applications. You can find further documentation about PocketSphinx
in the release documentation, or at the <a
href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/pocketsphinx/">online documentation</a>.
</p>

<a name=sphinx3>
<h3>Sphinx-3</h3>

<p>Sphinx-3 is CMU's state-of-the-art large vocabulary speech
recognition system. It uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with continuous
output probability density functions (PDF).  It supports several modes
of operation.  The more accurate mode, known as the "flat decoder", is
descended from the original Sphinx-3 release (still available for
reference purposes at <a
href="https://cmusphinx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cmusphinx/trunk/archive_s3/s3">https://cmusphinx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cmusphinx/trunk/archive_s3/s3</a>).
The faster mode, known as the "tree decoder", was developed
separately.  The two decoders were merged in Sphinx 3.5, though the
flat decoder was not fully functional until Sphinx 3.7.
Further documentation can be found in the release documentation, or
at the <a href="http://cmusphinx.org/sphinx3">online
documentation</a>.
</p>

<a name=sphinx4>
<h3>Sphinx-4</h3>

<p>
Sphinx-4 is a state-of-the-art speech recognition system written
entirely in the Java(tm) programming language. It uses Hidden Markov
Models (HMM) with continuous output probability density functions
(PDF).
</p>

href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/">Sphinx-4</a> page.
</p>

<a name=SphinxTrain>
<h3>SphinxTrain</h3>

<p>
SphinxTrain is CMU Sphinx's training package. It trains models in
Sphinx-3 format, which can also be converted to Sphinx-2 format under
some conditions related to Sphinx-2's limitations. At this point,
Sphinx-4 uses Sphinx-3 models. 
</p>

<a name=sphinx2>
<h3>Sphinx-2</h3>

<p>
Sphinx-2 is a fast speech recognition system, the predecessor of
PocketSphinx.  It is not being actively developed at this time, but is
still widely used in interactive applications.  It uses Hidden Markov
Models (HMM) with semi-continuous output probability density functions
(PDF). Even though it is not as accurate as Sphinx-3 or Sphinx-4, it
runs at real time, and therefore it is a good choice for live
applications. You can find further documentation about Sphinx-2 in the
release documentation, or at the <a
href="http://cmusphinx.org/sphinx2">online documentation</a>.
</p>

<a name=comparison>
<h3>Comparison</h3>

<p>We have some <a
href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmusphinx/twiki/view/Sphinx4/WebHome#Regression_Tests">
regression tests</a> comparing sphinx4 to s3 (flat decoder) and to
s3.3 (fast decoder) in several different tasks, ranging from digits
only to medium-large vocab. s3 (flat decoder) is often the most
accurate, but Sphinx4 is faster and more accurate than sphinx3.3 in
some of these tests.
</p>
<p>If you're familiar with ARPA evaluations (using databases available
via the <a href="http://ldc.upenn.edu">Linguistic Data Consortium
(LDC)</a> at U.Penn), you can find WSJ 5k and RM1 results in the
"Medium vocab" table, and WSJ 20k in the "Large vocab" table.
</p>
<p>The decision about which version to use depends on how familiar you
are with C (sphinx3) or Java (sphinx4), and how easy it is to
integrate these into your system.
