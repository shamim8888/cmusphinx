<p>The information presented here provides information about current
uses of the severla versions of Sphinx. These may be used as
guidelines, but keep in mind that there is no definite answer.

<h3>Sphinx-2</h3>

<p>
Sphinx-2 is CMU's fastest speech recognition system. It uses Hidden
Markov Models (HMM) with semi-continuous output probability density
functions (PDF). Even though it is not as accurate as Sphinx-3 or
Sphinx-4, it runs at real time, and therefore it is a good choice for
live applications. You can find further documentation about Sphinx-2
in the release documentation, or at the <a
href="http://cmusphinx.org/sphinx2">online documentation</a>.
</p>

<a name=sphinx3>
<h3>Sphinx-3</h3>

<p>Sphinx-3 is CMU's state-of-the-art large vocabulary speech
recognition system. It uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with continuous
output probability density functions (PDF). Sphinx-3 has two versions
available. 
</p>

<p>Historically, Sphinx-3 was first developed for batch processing. As
such, accuracy was much more of an issue than speed. This initial
version is often referred to as <em>s3</em>, <em>s3 slow</em>, or
<em>s3 flat</em>. This version is kept in the CVS repository in a
module named <code>s3flat</code>.
</p>

<p>
A live, fast version was then developed, and released. This version,
capable of handling live audio input, was referred to as
<em>s3.3</em>, <em>s3 fast</em>, <em>s3 lex tree</em>.
</p>

<p>
This live version underwent several improvements in the last 2
years. This version is referred to as <em>s3.X</em>, and, since it
replaces s3.3, it inherited the monikers <em>s3 fast</em> and <em>s3
lex tree</em>. This is the version kept in the CVS repository as the
module named <code>sphinx3</code>.
</p>

<p>Further documentation can be found in the release documentation, or
at the <a href="http://cmusphinx.org/sphinx3">online
documentation</a>.
</p>

<a name=sphinx4>
<h3>Sphinx-4</h3>

<p>
Sphinx-4 is a state-of-the-art speech recognition system written
entirely in the Java(tm) programming language. It uses Hidden Markov
Models (HMM) with continuous output probability density functions
(PDF).
</p>
<p>
For further detail, please check the <a
href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/">Sphinx-4</a> page.
</p>

<a name=SphinxTrain>
<h3>SphinxTrain</h3>

<p>
SphinxTrain is CMU Sphinx's training package. It trains models in
Sphinx-3 format, which can also be converted to Sphinx-2 format under
some conditions related to Sphinx-2's limitations. At this point,
Sphinx-4 uses Sphinx-3 models. 
</p>

<a name=comparison>
<h3>Comparison</h3>

<p>We have some <a
href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmusphinx/twiki/view/Sphinx4/WebHome#Regression_Tests">
regression tests</a> comparing sphinx4 to s3 (flat decoder) and to
s3.3 (fast decoder) in several different tasks, ranging from digits
only to medium-large vocab. s3 (flat decoder) is often the most
accurate, but Sphinx4 is faster and more accurate than sphinx3.3 in
some of these tests.
</p>
<p>If you're familiar with ARPA evaluations (using databases available
via the <a href="http://ldc.upenn.edu">Linguistic Data Consortium
(LDC)</a> at U.Penn), you can find WSJ 5k and RM1 results in the
"Medium vocab" table, and WSJ 20k in the "Large vocab" table.
</p>
<p>The decision about which version to use depends on how familiar you
are with C (sphinx3) or Java (sphinx4), and how easy it is to
integrate these into your system.
