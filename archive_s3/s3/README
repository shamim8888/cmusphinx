SPHINX-III Decoder

**********************************************

This is the collection of Sphinx3 decoder programs.
There's the beginnings of documentation in doc/s3.html; however it is
far from complete.

The following components are provided:
  * s3decode	-- Viterbi decoder
  * s3dag	-- Shortest path search of Viterbi lattice
  * s3astar	-- A* search of Viterbi lattice to produce N-best list
  * s3align	-- Forced alignment for word/phone/state segmentation
  * s3allphone	-- Viterbi allphone decoder

The software collection is organized as follows:
  * ./Makefile.defines and ./Makefile -- Top-level Makefiles for Sphinx3.
  * ./src	-- Source files
  * ./include	-- Main include file (nothing much here)
  * ./lib/*	-- Compiled libraries binaries go here
  * ./bin/*	-- Compiled executables binaries go here
  * ./tests	-- Sample scripts and respective outputs
  * ./doc	-- Documentation (very incomplete)

To make the software for your platform:
  * Double-check Makefile.defines for platform specific definitions.
  * Update the S3ROOT definition in all the subdirectory Makefiles to
    point to your root S3 directory.  The Makefiles are:
    - src/libutil/Makefile
    - src/libio/Makefile
    - src/libfeat/Makefile
    - src/libmisc/Makefile
    - src/libfbs/Makefile* (note that there are several of these)
  * Check Makefile for compilation instructions.
