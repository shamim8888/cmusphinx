The s3.3 decoder is a live-mode capable version of the s3.2 decoder.
The decoder routine is stored in a library called libdecoder.a
The decoder function takes blocks of speech samples and returns partial 
hypotheses for the blocks decoded during runtime. An example of its
use is given in main_live_example.c

---------------
This s3.2 module contains the following programs:
  1. decode: The Sphinx-3 s3.2 decoder
  2. gausubvq: A utility for creating a compact, sub-vector quantized form of
     continuous density acoustic models.  The compact form is used to speed
     up acoustic likelihood computation in the decoder.

This module depends on the "libutil" library module.


This distribution (specifically, the Makefiles) has been prepared for Unix
platforms.  However, it should be easy to create an equivalent setup on the
Windows platform, and compile the software there as well.

For documentation on compiling and running the decoder, see doc/s3.html.
