GOOD EVENING WE BEGIN THIS EVENING WITH AMERICAN THREATS TO GET MORE (BN99EN_1.6.F3)
DEEPLY INVOLVED AGAINST THE SERBS IN WHAT IS LEFT OF YUGOSLAVIA EMPHASIS ON THREATS TONIGHT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AND ITS ALLIES IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION ARE TRYING TO STOP THE SERB CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF KOSOVO WITHOUT HAVING TO GET THEMSELVES TOO DEEPLY INVOLVED IT IS VERY TRICKY THE SERBS ARE TRYING TO CRUSH AN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT IN KOSOVO AND THE SERBIAN LEADER IS NOT EASILY RESTRAINED GIVEN HIS PROMISES IN THE PAST IT IS ALSO A DILEMMA FOR MR CLINTON FIRST HERE IS A. B. C.'S JOHN MCWETHY (BN99EN_1.7.F0)
WITH VILLAGES IN KOSOVO GOING UP IN SMOKE NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS IN (BN99EN_1.8.F0)
BRUSSELS ISSUED THE TOUGHEST WARNING YET TO YUGOSLAV PRESIDENT SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC (BN99EN_1.9.F4)
STOP THE KILLING OF ETHNIC ALBANIANS WHO LIVE IN KOSOVO WITHDRAW YOUR HEAVY FORCES AND BEGIN PEACE TALKS OR FACE THE POSSIBILITY OF MILITARY ACTION BY THE WEST (BN99EN_1.10.F4)
TODAY WE TOOK SOME IMPORTANT STEPS TO ENSURE THAT MR MILOSEVIC KNOWS THAT HIS INDISCRIMINATE USE OF FORCE IS UNACCEPTABLE (BN99EN_1.11.F0)
THE PLANNING IS UNDER WAY AND THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS TO BELGRADE THINK AGAIN CHANGE YOUR MIND CHANGE YOUR TACTICS (BN99EN_1.12.F5)
THE FIRST STEP IS TO BE A SHOW OF FORCE SOMETIME IN THE NEXT WEEK JET FIGHTERS AND BOMBERS FROM AT LEAST THE U. S. (BN99EN_1.13.F4)
BRITAIN AND FRANCE WILL CONDUCT PRACTICE AIR STRIKES ON BOMBING RANGES JUST ACROSS THE BORDER FROM KOSOVO IN NEIGHBORING ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA (BN99EN_1.14.F0)
AT THE SAME TIME NATO MILITARY PLANNERS ARE LOOKING AT MUCH TOUGHER OPTIONS THAT PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY COULD INCLUDE AIR STRIKES AGAINST YUGOSLAV MILITARY AND POLICE UNITS THERE ARE DEEP MISGIVINGS HERE AT THE PENTAGON ABOUT (BN99EN_1.15.F4)
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DROPPING BOMBS TO MAKE DIPLOMATIC POINTS AND AS ALWAYS (BN99EN_1.16.F0)
CONCERNS THAT CIVILIANS COULD BE HURT MORE THAN SOLDIERS (BN99EN_1.17.F4)
THERE ARE NO EASY CHOICES TO BE MADE HERE IF THE IF THE SITUATION CANNOT BE BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL IN KOSOVO ALL OF THE OPTIONS ARE BAD (BN99EN_1.18.F1)
IN BOSNIA TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO THE U. S. PUSHED THE ALLIES INTO A MASSIVE AIR CAMPAIGN THAT EVENTUALLY DROVE MILOSEVIC AND HIS BOSNIAN SERB ALLIES TO THE BARGAINING TABLE (BN99EN_1.19.F4)
THIS TIME IT IS THE EUROPEANS PUSHING THE UNITED STATES WITH THE HOPE THAT JUST THE THREAT OF AIR STRIKES WILL BE ENOUGH TO MAKE DIPLOMACY WORK AGAIN JOHN MCWETHY A. B. C. NEWS THE PENTAGON (BN99EN_1.20.F0)
PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD ANOTHER MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY ISSUE ON THE AGENDA TODAY THAT IS HIS PENDING TRIP TO CHINA HE HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK BY THOSE WHO SAY HE HAS ABANDONED THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS WITH THE CHINESE SOMETHING HE PROMISED NEVER TO DO WHEN HE RAN AGAINST GEORGE BUSH IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO A. B. C.'S SAM DONALDSON IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE SAM (BN99EN_1.21.F0)
PETER THE PRESIDENT BASICALLY ARGUED TODAY THAT GETTING TOUGH ON CHINA OVER HUMAN RIGHTS THE WAY HIS CRITICS WANT WOULD BE LIKE CUTTING OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE (BN99EN_1.22.F0)
BEFORE AN INVITED AUDIENCE AT THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON THE PRESIDENT NOTED (BN99EN_1.23.F4)
THAT A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION IS CHINESE (BN99EN_1.24.F4)
SEEKING TO ISOLATE CHINA IS CLEARLY UNWORKABLE MOST IMPORTANT CHOOSING ISOLATION OVER ENGAGEMENT WOULD NOT MAKE THE WORLD SAFER IT WOULD MAKE IT MORE DANGEROUS (BN99EN_1.25.F0)
THE PRESIDENT SAID ENGAGEMENT IS PAYING DIVIDENDS IN (BN99EN_1.26.F4)
COOPERATION ON NUCLEAR NON PROLIFERATION COMBATING TERRORISM AND INTERNATIONAL CRIME ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS TRADE AND EVEN HE SAID IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS (BN99EN_1.27.F0)
SEEKING TO ISOLATE CHINA WILL NOT FREE ONE MORE POLITICAL DISSIDENT WILL NOT OPEN ONE MORE CHURCH TO THOSE WHO WISH TO WORSHIP INSTEAD IT WILL LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ADVANCE HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL FREEDOM (BN99EN_1.28.F0)
MR CLINTON SAID HE WILL PRESS THE CHINESE LEADERS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DURING HIS VISIT (BN99EN_1.29.F4)
BUT HE WILL ATTEND THE TRADITIONAL WELCOMING CEREMONY IN TIANANMEN SQUARE (BN99EN_1.30.F0)
EVEN THOUGH THAT IS THE PLACE WHERE CHINESE DISSIDENTS WERE MASSACRED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE (BN99EN_1.31.F4)
IF THE CHOICE IS (BN99EN_1.32.F4)
BETWEEN MAKING A SYMBOLIC POINT AND MAKING A REAL DIFFERENCE I CHOOSE TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE (BN99EN_1.33.F0)
BUT TO SOME CRITICS THE SYMBOLISM IS THE DIFFERENCE (BN99EN_1.34.F4)
I FEAR THE SYMBOLISM OF THAT VISIT TO TIANANMEN SQUARE WHERE NINE YEARS AGO STUDENTS WERE MURDERED WILL OVERWHELM EVERYTHING ELSE HE DOES (BN99EN_1.35.F1)
AND TO OTHER CRITICS THIS TRIP ITSELF IS BEING MADE FOR THE WRONG REASONS (BN99EN_1.36.F4)
THIS IS ABOUT PROFITS FOR SOME LARGE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES AT THE EXPENSE OF MOST PRODUCTS MADE IN AMERICA AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR NATIONAL VALUES (BN99EN_1.37.F1)
WHILE IN BEIJING THE PRESIDENT INTENDS TO GO TO CHURCH THAT (BN99EN_1.38.F4)
SUNDAY TO MAKE HIS POINT ABOUT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE NEXT DAY SPEAK OUT FORCEFULLY AT BEIJING UNIVERSITY ON HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICIALS HERE BELIEVE THE CHINESE WILL BE IMPRESSED AND HOPE THAT HIS DOMESTIC CRITICS WILL BE ALSO (BN99EN_1.39.F0)

YUGOSLAV PRESIDENT MILOSEVIC THE MAN NATO WAS TRYING TO INTIMIDATE MADE NO PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THE MESSAGE HE DID APPEAR WITH MILITARY LEADERS THIS MORNING BUT BELGRADE'S GOVERNMENT TELEVISION CALLED IT AN INTERNATIONAL SCANDAL CONDEMNED BY RUSSIA SERBIA'S TRADITIONAL ALLY IN A RARE FOREIGN TRIP MILOSEVIC WENT TO MOSCOW THIS AFTERNOON FOR TALKS WITH PRESIDENT YELTSIN TOMORROW KOSOVO IS ON THEIR AGENDA (BN99EN_1.55.F4)

MORE REFUGEES ARRIVED IN ALBANIA JOINING AT LEAST FORTY THOUSAND OTHERS THERE AND HERE IN BELGRADE THERE WAS SOME PUBLIC CRITICISM OF MILOSEVIC (BN99EN_1.58.F4)
(BN99EN_1.59.FX)
HE NEEDS PROBLEMS IN KOSOVO THESE WOMEN SAY TO DIVERT PUBLIC ATTENTION FROM THE ECONOMIC MESS IN YUGOSLAVIA (BN99EN_1.60.F4)
STILL MOST PEOPLE ON THE STREETS WERE FOCUSED MORE ON YUGOSLAVIA'S WORLD CUP VICTORY (BN99EN_1.61.F4)
THE MISSION WAS OVER IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS MESSAGE DELIVERED THE QUESTION IS WHETHER ANYBODY HERE HEARD IT OR BELIEVED IT JIM WOOTEN A. B. C. NEWS BELGRADE (BN99EN_1.62.F0)
IF PRESIDENT MILOSEVIC DID NOT GET THE MESSAGE THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION IS HOPING THAT BORIS YELTSIN WILL BE ABLE TO STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT WHEN HE MEETS WITH THE SERBIAN LEADER IN MOSCOW TOMORROW A. B. C.'S SAM DONALDSON IS IN WASHINGTON TONIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE SAM (BN99EN_1.63.F0)

PRESS SECRETARY MIKE MCCURRY PUT IT THIS WAY (BN99EN_1.66.F4)
PRESIDENT YELTSIN INDICATED THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO EVERYTHING HE COULD TO CONVINCE MR MILOSEVIC OF THE PRECARIOUSNESS OF SERBIA'S POSITION (BN99EN_1.67.F1)
(BN99EN_1.68.FX)
BUT EVERYTHING DOES NOT INCLUDE RUSSIA'S BACKING OF THE THREAT OF FORCE RUSSIA OPPOSES NATO USING FORCE IN THE BALKANS AND MILOSEVIC KNOWS IT SO MCCURRY HAD TO SAY THAT DESPITE (BN99EN_1.69.F4)
RUSSIA'S OBJECTION A U. N. RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE USE OF FORCE MIGHT STILL BE NECESSARY (BN99EN_1.70.F0)
AND AS FOR RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER SERGEYVE'S PUBLIC COMPLAINT THAT NO ONE HAD GIVEN MOSCOW ADVANCE NOTICE (BN99EN_1.71.F4)
OF THE WEEKEND NATO EXERCISES (BN99EN_1.72.F4)
STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN JAMIE RUBIN HAD TO DISPUTE THAT (BN99EN_1.73.F4)
THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES WERE WELL AWARE OF WHAT NATO WAS PLANNING AND AND WE WERE SOMEWHAT SURPRISED THEREFORE AT THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF OF SHOCK (BN99EN_1.74.F1)
THE HOPE HERE IS THAT YELTSIN WILL MAKE AN IMPACT ON MILOSEVIC BUT THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH MILOSEVIC HAS A HISTORY CHARLIE OF NOT BACKING DOWN UNTIL HE IS FORCED TO (BN99EN_1.75.F4)

TEAM IRAQ IS ANGRY THAT THE INSPECTORS REFUSED TO DECLARE THAT IRAQ IS ELIMINATED ALL ITS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THE HEAD OF THE U. N. TEAM RICHARD BUTLER CUT SHORT HIS TALKS WITH IRAQI LEADERS BUT HE INSISTS THE SITUATION HAS NOT REACHED A CRISIS THE B. B. C.'S ROGER HERRING IN BAGHDAD SAYS SADDAM HUSSEIN'S ACTION WILL LOSE HIM NO SUPPORT AT HOME (BN99EN_2.489.F0)
I THINK THERE IS QUITE A STRONG POPULAR FEELING HERE AT THE MOMENT AGAINST THE U. N. AND TO SOME EXTENT AGAINST THE AMERICANS WHO THEY SEE AS BEING BEHIND A LOT OF WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON THERE IS A FEELING HERE THEY DO NOT WANT ANYMORE OF THESE SANCTIONS THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A WAY OUT OF IT THROUGH THE NORMAL MEANS THEY HAVE TRIED HARD THEY CLAIM TO PROVE THEY DO NOT HAVE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION ANYMORE AS FAR AS THEY ARE CONCERNED THE U. N. TURNS AROUND AND SAYS NO I AM SORRY WE WANT MORE DETAIL EVERY TIME AGAIN AND AGAIN (BN99EN_2.490.FX)
RICHARD BUTLER THE U. N. MEDIATOR IN THIS AND THE HEAD OF THE U. N. INSPECTORS IS INSISTING THAT THE SITUATION IS NOT A CRISIS IS THAT A FEELING THAT BASICALLY THE IRAQI PARLIAMENT AND THE IRAQI PRESIDENT SHARE OR ARE THEY A LITTLE BIT MORE UPSET THAN THAT (BN99EN_2.491.F1)
I THINK THERE IS VERY MUCH A STRONG FEELING HERE THAT CRISIS IS WHAT IT IS AND IT MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS CRISES EVERYBODY ONE MEETS IN THE STREET A LOT OF THE U. N. OFFICIALS WHO ARE STILL HERE SAY THIS IS IN IF ANYTHING GRAVER THAN THE SITUATION WE WERE IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR BECAUSE THIS TIME INSTEAD OF REJECTING THE INSPECTORS OVER SOMETHING LIKE THE INVESTIGATION OF PRESIDENTIAL SITES THESE PLACES THAT THE IRAQI'S ORIGINALLY WOULD NOT LET THE INSPECTORS GO THIS TIME WE HAVE GOT A REJECTION OF THE WHOLE PROCESS AND THAT IS GOING TO BE A MUCH MUCH HARDER THING TO FIX (BN99EN_2.492.FX)
EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE TO US IF YOU COULD WHAT WHAT IS THE THE PROCESS THAT THEY ARE HAVING A DISAGREEMENT OVER AS I UNDERSTAND IT THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN CLEARED PRETTY MUCH BY THE U. N. ON THE ISSUE WHETHER THEY HAVE NUCLEAR OR OR A CHEMICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM AND THE ISSUE IS OVER BIOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES (BN99EN_2.493.F1)
YES TECHNICALLY THE NUCLEAR AND THE MISSILE FILE AND THE CHEMICAL FILE ARE NOT AS YET WOUND UP BUT THE BIOLOGICAL ONE IS CERTAINLY THE ONE THAT IS CAUSING THE MOST PROBLEMS BUT WHAT THE U. N. INSPECTORS HAVE BEEN SAYING IS OH JUST GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AND THEN YOU KNOW ROUND THE CORNER WILL COME THE TIME WHEN WE CAN END THE PROCESS AND LIFT SANCTIONS AND THE IRAQIS SAY WELL WE HAVE HEARD THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND NOW WE ARE TOLD YOU GOT TO DO THIS LITTLE BIT MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE MORE EVIDENCE MORE DOCUMENTS AND AT THE SAME TIME THE U. N. ACCUSING THEM OF NOT BEING HONEST WITH THEM ABOUT VARIOUS THINGS AND THEY SAY WELL TO HELL WITH IT WE WILL NOT DO THIS BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET WHAT WE WANT SO WE ARE GOING TO TRY AND FIND ANOTHER WAY (BN99EN_2.494.FX)
WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT DO YOU THINK THE IRAQI'S FEEL THEY CAN COUNT ON IF THE POINT THEY ARE BASICALLY TRYING TO MAKING IS THAT THE SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY PUNISHING AND THAT ARE NO LONGER DESERVED ESPECIALLY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE (BN99EN_2.495.F1)
WELL I THINK THEY HAVE GOT A LOT OF ALLIES ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL AS WELL AS IN THE REGION HERE WHO FEEL THAT THE FRENCH THE CHINESE AND THE RUSSIANS ON THE SECURITY COUNCIL ARE CERTAINLY SUGGESTED THAT THEY HAVE SYMPATHY WITH THAT VIEW AND I THINK IN THE REGION HERE EVEN THEIR OLD ENEMY IRAN SEEMS TO BE TAKING A A RATHER MORE LIBERAL VIEW OF THINGS AND PERHAPS THAT MIGHT BE ONE AREA WHERE THEY COULD ACTUALLY SUSPEND SANCTIONS UNILATERALLY IF YOU LIKE JUST RESTART TRADE WITH IRAN WITH SYRIA PERHAPS ALSO WITH JORDAN AND JUST GET ON WITH IT AND SAY WELL WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE SANCTIONS (BN99EN_2.496.FX)
THE B. B. C.'S ROGER HERRING SPEAKING WITH US FROM BAGHDAD (BN99EN_2.497.F0)
GERHARD SCHROEDER WHO IS CAMPAIGNING TO BE THE NEXT CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY IN ELECTIONS THIS SEPTEMBER MET TODAY WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON IN WASHINGTON SCHROEDER CURRENTLY LEADS CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL BY THREE TO FOUR POINTS IN GERMAN OPINION POLLS AS THE WORLD'S PAUL MILLER REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT A CHANGE IN GERMAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT MEAN (BN99EN_2.498.F0)
GERHARD SCHROEDER APPARENTLY HAS ALREADY LEARNED A LOT FROM BILL CLINTON FOR EXAMPLE HE HAS COPIED CLINTON'S ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN RIGHT DOWN TO THE SLOGAN IT IS THE ECONOMY STUPID SCHROEDER WOULD LIKE TO JOIN MR CLINTON AND BRITAIN'S TONY BLAIR AS NEW GENERATION CENTRIST LEADERS OF WESTERN POWERS RICHARD BERT A FORMER AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY SAYS SCHROEDER SHOULD WIN SIMPLY BECAUSE HIS OPPONENT HELMUT KOHL HAS BEEN CHANCELLOR FOR SIXTEEN YEARS (BN99EN_2.499.F0)
MOST GERMANS BELIEVE THAT IT IS TIME FOR A CHANGE AND SO MOST OF THE GERMANS THAT I TALKED TO AND MOST OF THE EXPERTS THAT FOLLOW THESE THINGS BELIEVE THAT IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT KOHL CAN HOLD ONTO POWER AND THAT IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER GERHARD SCHROEDER WILL BE THE NEXT CHANCELLOR (BN99EN_2.500.F2)
WHAT CHANGES SCHROEDER WOULD MAKE AS CHANCELLOR SEEM UNCERTAIN PART OF THE REASON FOR HIS TRIP TO WASHINGTON WAS TO REASSURE OFFICIALS HERE THAT WHILE HE HEADS A TRADITIONALLY LEFTIST PARTY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATCS OR S. P. D. HE WILL CONTINUE GERMANY'S COMMITMENT TO CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES AND TO EUROPEAN UNITY BUT ANN PHILLIPS A PROFESSOR AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITY SAYS SCHROEDER WOULD BRING A DIFFERENT TONE TO RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES SHE SAYS THE DEFERENCE OF KOHL AND OTHER OLDER GERMANS BASED ON GRATITUDE FOR U. S. HELP IN REBUILDING THEIR COUNTRY AFTER WORLD WAR TWO WOULD BE GONE AND PHILLIPS SAYS SCHROEDER'S S. P. D. DOES NOT ACCEPT THE AMERICAN IDEA THAT GERMANY SHOULD TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY IN EUROPE AS LONG AS IT SERVES AMERICAN INTEREST TOO (BN99EN_2.501.F0)
MORE RESPONSIBILITY DOES NOT MEAN FOLLOWING U. S. POLICY WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT EUROPE SHOULD BE AN EQUAL PARTNER WITH THE UNITED STATES IN GLOBAL POLITICS (BN99EN_2.502.F1)
AS TO SPECIFIC POLICIES GERHARD SCHROEDER IS HARD TO PIN DOWN ANN PHILLIPS SAYS HIS PRAGMATISM DOMINATES (BN99EN_2.503.F0)
IF YOU LOOK AT SCHROEDER'S POLICY ONE WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND CORE PRINCIPALS THAT HAVE BEEN THE BACKBONE OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER UNLIKE KOHL WHO HAS ALWAYS STOOD FOR EUROPEAN INTEGRATION IN THE TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP (BN99EN_2.504.F1)
SCHROEDER'S CRITICS ARE LESS KIND THEY SAY HE CHANGES POLICIES AS READILY AS HE CHANGES WIVES AND HE IS ON HIS FOURTH MARRIAGE CHANCELLOR KOHL SAYS SCHROEDER STANDS FOR EVERYTHING AND NOTHING KOHL IS ALSO RAISING THE SPECTER OF AN UNWORKABLE COALITION GOVERNMENT SCHROEDER'S PARTY IS NOT EXPECTED TO WIN AN OUTRIGHT MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT AND WOULD HAVE TO FIND ALLIES PERHAPS IN WHAT IS CALLED A RED GREEN COALITION RED FOR THE S. P. D. AND PERHAPS THE FORMER COMMUNISTS IN EASTERN GERMANY GREEN FOR THE ENVIRONMENTALIST GREEN PARTY RICHARD BERT SAYS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COALITION MEMBERS AND WITHIN SCHROEDER'S S. P. D. PARTY MAKE IT EVEN HARDER TO SAY WHAT A SCHROEDER GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES MIGHT BE (BN99EN_2.505.F0)
THERE WILL BE SOME REAL BATTLES BETWEEN SAY THE PRAGMATIST WING OF OF THE S. P. D. AND THE GREENS HAVE THEIR OWN PRAGMATIST AND THE AND THE SO CALLED FUNDAMENTALISTS SO THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY I THINK IF SCHROEDER IS ELECTED ABOUT WHAT GERMAN POLICY WILL LOOK LIKE IN IN THE YEARS AHEAD (BN99EN_2.506.F2)
RIGHT NOW SCHROEDER IS CONCENTRATING ON WINNING THE ELECTION BY ATTACKING KOHL'S ECONOMIC RECORD AND BY PROMISING TO LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT AND ENCOURAGE ENTREPRENUERSHIP AND HIGH TECHNOLOGY SPECIFICS ON POLICY MAY NOT MATTER THAT MUCH TO AN ELECTORATE THAT APPARENTLY WANTS NEW FACES AND NEW IDEAS FOR NOW AMERICAN OFFICIALS WILL HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH GENERAL REASSURANCES FOR THE WORLD I AM PAUL MILLER IN WASHINGTON (BN99EN_2.507.F0)

TIME NOW FOR A SPIN THROUGH THE WORLD'S BACKPAGES ONE THING THAT BOTH GERMANS AND AMERICANS LOVE IS BEER BUT DO NOT COUNT OUT THE BRITISH THIS WEEK AT THE GREAT BRITISH BEER FESTIVAL IN LONDON OVER FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL QUAFF A QUARTER OF A MILLION PINTS OF VARIOUS BREWS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE PRESUMABLY THERE WILL BE A FEW PRETZELS ON HAND (BN99EN_2.509.F3)
YOU RECOGNIZE THIS SOUND WELL IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD THESE DAYS FROGS ARE BEING HEARD LESS AND LESS ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE CONCERNED AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN EXPLANATION AND A CURE FOR THE DYING FROG POPULATIONS EVEN ONE OF THE LATEST (BN99EN_2.510.F4)
MOST PROMISING THEORIES ON THIS DISAPPEARING FROG PROBLEM NOW APPEARS TO BE IN TROUBLE ITSELF JOINING ME NOW IS DR JOHN MAKERO HE IS A PROFESSOR OF VERTEBRATE ECOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY AT GRIFFITH UNIVERSITY GOLD COAST IN AUSTRALIA THANKS FOR JOINING US PROFESSOR SCIENTISTS LIKE YOURSELF HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE PROBLEM OF DYING FROG POPULATIONS FOR CLOSE TO TWENTY YEARS IF NOT MORE THE SO CALLED FUNGUS THEORY I GUESS WAS THE LATEST ATTEMPT FOR A SEARCH FOR AN ANSWER WHAT IS IT AND WHY IS IT LIKELY NOT TO BE THE ANSWER (BN99EN_2.511.F0)
THE FUNGUS HAS BEEN FOUND ON THE SKIN OF SOME OF DYING FROGS IN JUST THE LAST YEAR OR SO IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THIS FUNGUS IS ACTUALLY THE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CERTAIN AND BUT IT IS CERTAINLY IS VERY EXCITING AND PROMISING THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE CANNOT JUMP TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AS THE CAUSE OF DEATH AND NOR HAVE CAN WE THEN EVEN MAKE A MUCH GREATER LEAP AND SAY THAT IT IS ACTUALLY THE CAUSE OF THE DECLINES ON A GLOBAL SCALE (BN99EN_2.512.FX)
IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT PEOPLE WOULD LOOK FOR A SINGLE SOLUTION FOR A PROBLEM WHICH IS SO BIG AND SO THREATENING SO FRIGHTENING IN A WAY TO ENVIRONMENTALISTS BUT IS THERE LIKELY TO BE A SINGLE ANSWER (BN99EN_2.513.F1)
I I THINK IT IS VERY UNLIKELY WE HAVE BEEN HAD FROGS MISSING IN AUSTRALIA NOW SINCE 1979 AND MANY SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE PROBLEM IF IT WAS A SIMPLE ANSWER THEN I THINK WE WOULD HAVE HOPEFULLY FOUND IT A LONG TIME AGO WHAT WE THINK IS THAT FROGS SUFFERING FROM WHAT WE CALL IMMUNO DEPRESSION WHICH MEANS THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO COPE WITH NORMAL DISEASES OR INFECTIONS LIKE A FUNGUS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE COPED WITHIN THE PAST AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEN IT HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING MAYBE EVEN ON A GLOBAL SCALE SOMETHING LIKE GLOBAL WARMING SOMETHING LIKE INCREASED U. V. RADIATION ALL OF THESE TYPES OF PRESSURES WHICH OBVIOUSLY HAVE A HUMAN SOURCE WEAKEN THE FROGS AND THEREFORE MAKE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO WHAT OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ACQUIRED NATURAL DISEASE (BN99EN_2.514.FX)
LIKE ANY SPECIES CERTAINLY THE CONCERN OF PEOPLE FOR ITS SURVIVAL IS A SPECIFIC ONE BUT IT IS ALSO MORE GENERAL IS NOT IT ARE FROGS IN A SENSE KIND OF A DISTANT EARLY WARNING SYSTEM FOR US OF THREATS THAT MAY BE FACING MORE MORE COMPLICATED ANIMALS HUMANS THEMSELVES (BN99EN_2.515.F1)
WELL IT IS CERTAINLY THE CATCH CRIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING IS THAT THE FROGS MAY BE THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE I THINK IT IS A GOOD ANALOGY I THINK IF WE FIND IN AUSTRALIA FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE SEVEN SPECIES THAT HAVE DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY AND WHO IS GOING TO DISAPPEAR NEXT IF IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE KOALA OR THE GRIZZLY BEAR IN NORTH AMERICA THEN PEOPLE WOULD BE SCREAMING AND YELLING AND THEY WOULD BE VERY MUCH FEARING FOR THEIR OWN LIVES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS MYSTERIOUS THESE FROGS ARE DISAPPEARING IN RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED AREAS THEY ARE IN IN AUSTRALIA IN THE CORE OF LARGE NATIONAL PARKS (BN99EN_2.516.FX)
WHAT ABOUT THE BIODIVERSITY ISSUE WHAT WHAT DO WE GET FROM FROGS THAT WE WOULD BE LOSING IF THEY WERE TO DIE OUT (BN99EN_2.517.F1)
WELL ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING FROGS IN THE WORLD WAS THE GASTRIC BROODING FROG IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THE FEMALE ATE THE EGGS AND THE TADPOLES DEVELOPED INSIDE HER STOMACH (BN99EN_2.518.FX)
(BN99EN_2.519.F1)
SOMEHOW SHE PRODUCED CHEMICALS IN HER STOMACH WHICH STOPPED HER FROM DIGESTING HER OWN TADPOLES AND HER OWN BABIES NOW THAT CHEMICAL COULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR HUMANS TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF STOMACH ULCERS AND SO THERE WAS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR THAT PARTICULAR SPECIES OF FROG TO MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO MEDICAL SCIENCE FOR HUMANS IT IS HARD TO PINPOINT THE THE VALUE OF SOMETHING LIKE A FROG BUT IT IS CERTAINLY I THINK JUST INHERENT IN ITS OWN RIGHT THAT IT IS A SPECIES ON THE PLANET AS I AM SAID EARLIER I GUESS LIKE A GRIZZLY BEAR OR THE BALD EAGLE IF WE LOSE THESE SPECIES THEN WE HAVE LOST A VERY PART OF OUR OWN HERITAGE AND OUR AND OUR OWN LIFE ITSELF (BN99EN_2.520.FX)

A SONG IN THE LOCAL LANGUAGE TAMIL BLARES OUT OF THE LOUDSPEAKER IN KUDANKULAM THIS IS A TYPICAL INDIAN VILLAGE WHERE NOT MUCH HAPPENS A ROW OF STORES RUNNING THROUGH THE CENTER PROVIDES WORK FOR SOME WHILE OTHERS FARM THE LAND BUT ABOVE ALL THE PEOPLE OF KUDANKULAM DEPEND ON THE SEA (BN99EN_2.528.FX)
(BN99EN_2.529.FX)
AND IT IS THE FISHING COMMUNITY WITH THE BACKING OF THEIR LOCAL CATHOLIC CHURCH THAT IS MAKING THE LOUDEST PROTESTS AGAINST THE NUCLEAR PROJECT AS WITH ANY WATER COOLED REACTOR THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF WATER FROM THE STATION NEEDS DUMPING AND AT KUDANKULAM IT WILL GOING INTO THE SEA ACCORDING TO PETER GASS PRESIDENT OF THE TAMIL NADU (BN99EN_2.530.FX)
FISH WORKERS' UNION IT IS ONLY NATURAL FOR THE FISHERMEN TO BE WORRIED (BN99EN_2.531.F5)
(BN99EN_2.532.FX)
BEING FISHERMEN WE ARE MAINLY DEPENDENT ON THE SEA FOR OUR LIVELIHOOD WHEN THIS PROJECT COMES ABOUT IT WILL REQUIRE TWO THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND AND FOR MAINTAINING THE NORMAL TEMPERATURE OF THE PLANT THEY WILL DRAW WATER FROM THE SEA AND DISCHARGE EFFLUENCE BACK INTO THE SEA WHICH MIGHT HARM THE SEA CREATURES AND IN THE EVENT OF ANY MISHAPS ALL THE NEIGHBORING AREAS WILL BE AFFECTED HENCE WE STRONGLY PROTEST THE COMING OF THIS (BN99EN_2.533.F4)
PROJECT (BN99EN_2.534.F0)
THE FISHERMEN HAVE ALREADY STAGED A DEMONSTRATION AND THEY ARE PREPARED TO MARCH ACROSS SOUTHERN INDIA AND AGITATE UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT DROPS THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER AND THEY ARE NOT JUST CONCERNED ABOUT POLLUTION TO THE SEA (BN99EN_2.535.F5)
(BN99EN_2.536.FX)
THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING TO EVACUATE THE PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THREE MILES OF THE PROJECT WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN RESTRICTED FROM CONSTRUCTING HOUSES AND THEY HAVE DEMOLISHED A SCHOOL SO WE FISHERMEN FEEL THAT WE DEFINITELY WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PLANT DOES NOT COME HERE (BN99EN_2.537.F4)
(BN99EN_2.538.FX)
WE ARE VERY AFRAID BECAUSE MOST OF OUR PEOPLE ARE NOT EDUCATED AND WHEN THE GOVERNMENT EVACUATES ALL OF US WE WILL HAVE TO START LIVING FROM SCRATCH AND WE WILL FEEL DEPRESSED DISILLUSIONED AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE UP ANY NEW VENTURES BECAUSE WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE SEA AND FISHING ACTIVITIES (BN99EN_2.539.F4)
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROJECT LIES WITH THE NUCLEAR POWER CORPORATION OF INDIA OR N. P. C. IT CATEGORICALLY DENIES THAT THERE WILL BE ANY EVACUATION AS THE AREA REQUIRED IS ALREADY FENCED OFF IT SAYS THAT THE EXCLUSION ZONE WITH A RADIUS OF JUST TWO KILOMETERS WAS ALREADY BARREN LAND SIAR PERAHCORIN IS PROJECT ENGINEER FOR KUDANKULAM AT THE N. P. C. HE SAYS THERE IS NO CHANCE OF CONTAMINATING THE SEA AND IN FACT THE POWER STATION MIGHT EVEN BENEFIT FISH PRODUCTION (BN99EN_2.540.F5)
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO POSSIBILITY OF CONTAMINATION OF WHAT SO EVER AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION THIS FIVE DEGREES INCREASE IN THE SEA WATER TEMPERATURE WILL NOT HARM ANY OF THIS FISH SPECIES TO THE CONTRARY WE HAVE FORMED FROM OUR EXPERIENCE IN OTHER STATIONS COASTAL STATION THAT THIS IS REALLY BENEFICIAL TO THE FISH SPECIES AND THOSE THINGS (BN99EN_2.541.FX)
THE FOUR MAIN STATES OF SOUTH INDIA ARE SUFFERING FROM ACUTE POWER SHORTAGES THE PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY AT A CHEAPER PRICE AND TO LESSEN RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS THERE ARE ALREADY TEN NUCLEAR POWER REACTORS IN OPERATION IN INDIA THE FIRST WAS BUILT IN COLLABORATION WITH THE U. S. COMPANY GENERAL ELECTRIC OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTS OR THREAT TO PEOPLE IN THE AREAS AROUND THESE STATIONS ACCORDING TO EMDASS CHIEF ENGINEER AND DIRECTOR OF HEALTH SAFETY AND PUBLIC AWARENESS AT THE N. P. C. A LOT OF GROUNDWORK IS DONE BEFORE A NUCLEAR REACTOR IS BUILT (BN99EN_2.542.F5)
THEY START COLLECTING SAMPLES ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SAMPLES PER YEAR OF FLORA FAUNA FISH GRASS MILK AND THEN WHEN THE REACTORS ARE RUNNING THEY CONTINUE THAT EXERCISE AND THEY COMPARE AND SO FAR WE HAVE NOT FOUND ANY ABNORMALITY IN IN IN IN THE RADIATION EFFECT (BN99EN_2.543.FX)
THE KUDANKULAM SITE WAS ALSO APPROVED BY THE ATOMIC ENERGY REGULATORY BOARD AFTER IT CHECKED AND FOUND LITTLE THREAT FROM SEISMIC ACTIVITY NO THREAT FROM CYCLONIC STORMS AND NO NEED (BN99EN_2.544.F5)
TO CLEAR ANY FOREST (BN99EN_2.545.FX)
(BN99EN_2.546.FX)
BACK IN KUDANKULAM VILLAGE THE CENTER OF ALL THE ATTENTION THE FISHERMEN CANNOT EVEN RELY ON THE SUPPORT OF ALL THEIR NEIGHBORS ESPECIALLY THOSE NOT DEPENDENT ON FISHING PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE PROJECT SOME ARE STILL WILLING TO GIVE IT A CHANCE (BN99EN_2.547.FX)
(BN99EN_2.548.FX)
SO LONG AS THE GOVERNMENT MANAGES THE PROJECT WITHOUT ANY LEAKAGES OR PILFERING THE PROJECT IS WELCOME HERE (BN99EN_2.549.F4)

THEY MIGHT GENERATE SOME EMPLOYMENT HERE BUT TO WHAT EXTENT REMAINS TO BE SEEN BUT WE DO NOT FEEL THREATENED BY THE PROJECT (BN99EN_2.551.FX)
BUT WHILE OPINION IS DIVIDED THE OPPOSITION TO THE NUCLEAR PLANT IS DEEP FELT FOR THE MOMENT THE PROPOSED SITE IS JUST A VAST AREA OF BARREN LAND WALLED OFF TO THE LOCALS WITH A SIGN FORBIDDING ANY TRESPASSES IT WILL BE ANOTHER TEN YEARS BEFORE THE REACTOR ACTUALLY GOES INTO USE FOR THE WORLD THIS IS (BN99EN_2.552.F5)

HAD OUTSTANDING COOPERATION FROM BOTH THE GOVERNMENTS OF OF KENYA AND TANZANIA FROM THE OUTSET FOLLOWING THESE ATTACKS AND THEY ARE COOPERATING FULLY IN THE INVESTIGATION WE HAVE HAVE HAD ACCESS AND WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE SUSPECTS THAT HAVE BEEN DETAINED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE YOU KNOW WITH THE LAST FRIDAY'S EVENTS (BN99EN_2.619.F1)
THE FIRST GROUP OF SURVIVORS OF THE TWIN BLASTS IN EAST AFRICA HAVE ARRIVED BACK IN THE UNITED STATES THEY WERE MET AT ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE OUTSIDE WASHINGTON BY STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS THE SECRETARY OF STATE MADELEINE ALBRIGHT IS IN GERMANY TO ESCORT HOME THE BODIES OF AMERICANS KILLED IN THE FRIDAY'S TERRORIST ATTACK MS ALBRIGHT VISITED SOME OF THE INJURED FROM THE BOMBINGS IN THE U.

INVESTIGATORS IN KENYA AND TANZANIA ARE IN THE DIFFICULT PROCESS OF COLLECTING PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AT BOMB SITES AT THE U. S. EMBASSIES IN THE TWO EAST AFRICAN NATIONS THE TWIN BOMBINGS LAST FRIDAY LEFT NEARLY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY PEOPLE DEAD AND MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND OTHERS INJURED (BN99EN_2.621.F0)
SEVERAL AMERICAN EMBASSIES HAVE SHUT DOWN ROUTINE OPERATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THREATS AFTER THE TERRORIST ATTACKS THE UNITED STATES HAS ANNOUNCED A WORLDWIDE ALERT FOR EMBASSIES AND OTHER DIPLOMATIC INSTALLATIONS THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS BUILDINGS IN EGYPT MALAYSIA AND YEMEN MAY BE TARGETED NEXT PRESIDENT CLINTON MET WITH HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORS WEDNESDAY TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM (BN99EN_2.622.F0)
BRIAN JENKINS IS AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT ON TERRORISM AND INTERNATIONAL CRIME KENT KLEIN AND I TALKED WITH HIM EARLIER ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS ON AMERICAN SECURITY ABROAD I ASKED HIM WHERE THE NEW THREATS WERE COMING FROM AND IF INTERNATIONAL CRIME EXPERTS COULD TRACE THESE THREATS TO FIND OUT IF THEY ARE COMING FROM THE SAME GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS (BN99EN_2.623.F0)
WELL I I DO NOT NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT THE THE KINDS OF CLAIMS AND THREATS THAT WE GET FOLLOWING A TERRORIST ATTACK SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD ARE NECESSARILY CREDIBLE OR MAY ARE EVEN LINKED TO THE TO THE EVENTS THAT HAVE HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN IN AFRICA WE LIVE IN AN AGE IN WHICH THE ERUPTION OF A VOLCANO IN SOME DISTANT PART OF THE WORLD BRINGS CLAIMS BY TERRORISTS GROUPS FOR RESPONSIBILITY A LOT OF THESE ARE NOTHING MORE THAN FAXES SENT TO NEWS BUREAU BUREAUS OF VOICES ON TELEPHONES GROUPS ATTEMPTING TO CALL ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES OR DISCREDIT THEIR OPPONENTS OR SIMPLY CREATE DISINFORMATION AND ALARM (BN99EN_2.624.F2)
DO YOU THINK THAT THE MASSIVE DESTRUCTION IN TANZANIA AND NAIROBI WILL LEAD OTHER TERRORISTS TO TRY TO COMMIT SIMILAR ACTS AFTER THIS (BN99EN_2.625.F0)
THERE IS ALWAYS A CONCERN THAT AN ACTION LIKE THIS WILL WILL INSPIRE FURTHER ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND INDEED IN SOME CASES SPECTACULAR ACTS OF TERRORISM ARE ARE ARE FOLLOWED BY BY SMALLER SCALE SPONTANEOUS ACTS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE FEEL THAT NOW IS THE MOMENT TO TO JOIN THE BATTLE HOWEVER INSOFAR AS FURTHER SPECTACULAR ATTACKS THOSE TAKE MONTHS TO PLAN AND WHILE THEY COULD OCCUR IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY TAKING PLACE NOW THAT IS THE PLANNING WOULD ALREADY BE WOULD ALREADY BE IN PROCESS (BN99EN_2.626.F2)
MR JENKINS U. S. CITIZENS ARE BEING WARNED NOT TO TRAVEL TO KENYA AND TANZANIA BECAUSE THE EMBASSIES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE I SUPPOSE TOURISTS WILL NOW AVOID THE COUNTRIES WE JUST MENTIONED EGYPT MALAYSIA AND YEMEN THE EMBASSIES ALSO IN SAUDI ARABIA BAHRAIN AND LEBANON ARE TELLING AMERICANS IN THOSE COUNTRIES TO BE EXTRA VIGILANT HOW SAFE CAN AMERICANS FEEL NOW WHEN THEY TRAVEL ABROAD AFTER ALL YOU KNOW KENYA AND TANZANIA WERE CONSIDERED RATHER SAFE DESTINATIONS BEFORE THE BOMBINGS OCCURRED THERE (BN99EN_2.627.F1)
YOU KNOW IT IS TRUE THAT THE THE SPECTACULAR EVENTS DO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF OF FEAR AND ALARM AND INEVITABLY THEY WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE WILLINGNESS OF OF TOURISTS OR BUSINESS TRAVELERS TO GO TO THOSE TO THOSE COUNTRIES HOWEVER WITHOUT SOUNDING COLD BLOODED OR CALLOUS ABOUT THE THE THE CASUALTIES INVOLVED I I THINK AMERICANS DO HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THE MAGNITUDE OF OF OF THE THREAT THE ACTUAL RISKS THEY TAKE AN AVERAGE AMERICAN CITIZEN FACES ABOUT A ONE IN FIVE THOUSAND CHANCE OF DYING IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT ABOUT A ONE IN TWELVE THOUSAND CHANCE OF BEING A VICTIM OF HOMICIDE IN THIS COUNTRY THE PROBABILITY OF BEING KILLED BY A TERRORIST ABROAD IS ONE IN MILLIONS SO THAT SUGGESTS THAT PEOPLE TRAVELLING ABROAD FIRST OF ALL DRIVE VERY SAFELY ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT (BN99EN_2.628.F2)
AND FINALLY MR JENKINS HOW ARE THE INVESTIGATORS GOING TO FIND OUT WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS BOMB ATTACK IF NO ONE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY AND HOW CLOSE ARE THEY TO FINDING OUT WHO THAT IS (BN99EN_2.629.F0)
WE WE WE DO NOT KNOW HOW CLOSE THEY ARE OF COURSE THE RESCUE EFFORTS HAVE JUST BEEN COMPLETED AND NOW THE INVESTIGATORS TAKE OVER AND ARE ABLE TO REALLY BEGIN TO EXAMINE THE CRIME SCENE THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE CONCURRENTLY RIGHT NOW ONE IS A CONVENTIONAL POLICE INVESTIGATION THE INTERVIEWING OF EYEWITNESSES OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY THE IDENTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE SUSPECTS THOSE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF VEHICLES IN THOSE COUNTRIES THE KIND OF INVESTIGATION THAT WOULD ACCOMPANY ANY CRIME CONCURRENT WITH THAT OF OF COURSE IS AN ALL OUT EFFORT BY THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES BOTH THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES AND THOSE OF OUR ALLIES TO TO REDOUBLE EFFORTS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM ALL SOURCES INTELLIGENCE SOURCES THAT MAY TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THESE ATTACKS THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THE INVESTIGATION IS THE VERY PAINSTAKING PHYSICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE BOMB SITE AN ANALYSIS OF THE CHEMICAL RESIDUE ON THE SURFACES THAT FACED THE BLAST WILL GIVE US SOME IDEA OF THE KIND OF EXPLOSIVES THAT WERE USED A VERY CAREFUL SIFTING OF THE DEBRIS MAY ENABLE US TO IDENTIFY MORE ABOUT THE VEHICLE THAT WAS USED PERHAPS EVEN IDENTIFY COMPONENTS OF THE BOMB ITSELF THAT CAN TAKE WEEKS THAT CAN TAKE MONTHS EVEN YEARS BUT THUS FAR THE RECORD HAS BEEN PRETTY GOOD IN BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY ULTIMATELY IDENTIFY THE PERPETRATORS (BN99EN_2.630.F2)
