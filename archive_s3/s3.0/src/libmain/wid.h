 * Create mappings between dictionary and LM word-IDs.  In short:
 *    - An array of s3lmwid_t entries (map[]) is created; where map[i] is the LM word-ID for
 * 	the dictionary word-ID i.  Mappings are created for the alternative pronunciations as
 * 	well.  For words not in the LM, the corresponding entries are BAD_LMWID.
 *    - Similarly, lm->ug[u].dictwid is assigned the dictionary word id for unigram word u.
 * Return value: The map[] array built as described above.
