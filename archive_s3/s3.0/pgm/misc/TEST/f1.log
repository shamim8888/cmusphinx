that's true although i think ma and pa individual investors really don't buy long bonds if you look at the trend in c. d.'s this year what's interesting is the banks have been raising c. d. yields [[ => ON ]] since january february people are not rolling into the banks not into c. d.'s anyway what's really happened is that people [[ HAVE => IT ]] continued to pile money up in short term accounts in bank [[ => IS ]] passbook accounts in money market mutual funds so [[ THERE'S => OOZE ]] a lot of liquidity building and maybe there's going [[ TO => AN ]] be more building now in the wake what's happening [[ IN => ]] the stock market the issue is all that cash is out there does it necessarily have to come [[ INTO => IT OF ]] the equity market depends on how afraid people are [[ => SORT ]] the japanese have shown us if you scare people enough they'll stay in the bank for a half percentage point you know that's been a six year bear market there we're not talking about that yet here but you can scare people enough and and greed turns to fear in a hurry (k960712_065_F1_112273_117131) << 179 ref; 0 0.0% oov; 182 hyp; 174 97.2% corr; 9 5.0% err; 14.4s CPU >>

well on this particular bill it's a relatively [[ NONCONTROVERSIAL(oov) => CONTROVERSIAL ]] bill but i [[ THINK => IN ]] that in general in the spending bills this year you're [[ GOING => ]] to see a lot less controversy than you [[ DID => ]] last year when the when the republicans came in fresh from their victory in in nineteen ninety four sort of set on this this revolutionary tone they were out to change the shape and nature and the reach of of the federal government but that also caused big fights with the white house it caused the protracted budget fight in which you didn't get this year's budget [[ => IS ]] spending bills set [[ UNTIL => IT ]] the middle of the of the spending year the two government shutdowns for which they took the brunt of the blame [[ ACCORDING => OR ]] to [[ THE => VOTE ]] public opinion polls this year with an election coming up they want to [[ SHOW => A ]] that they can get the business of the country done that they can get it done in a timely way get it done without fighting get it done without without shutting the government down again so for instance or the bill that's going to [[ BE => ]] on the floor today the labor h. h. s. bill [[ IT => ]] covers it's a big bill covers [[ THE => ]] labor [[ DEPARTMENT => ]] health and [[ HUMAN => ITS ]] services education you're not going to see the big fights that [[ YOU => IS ]] saw last year over low income heating assistance programs over there there will be some abortion fights but nothing but that's sort of normal for this bill nothing reaching the the the fights you saw last year they really want to [[ SHOW => A ]] that they can get the business done and in a timely way it's also why they're talking about doing a a standby continuing resolution in case the president vetoes any of [[ THESE => A ]] spending bills they could get out of town at the end in the fall not get bogged down with this fight get out of town to campaign for reelection without worrying about the government shutting down (i960711p_006_F1_18482_27388) << 332 ref; 1 0.3% oov; 327 hyp; 316 95.2% corr; 17 5.1% err; 293.7s CPU >>
