now I'm done corrupting the tree.  In theory, we now have a fully automated
build system.  unfortunately we lost a few directories in the process, but
that's okay.  The only major thing remaining on my TODO list at this point is
to add a no-arch-dependant-code stub.  Still have to talk to kevin about this.

Fixed up a few script paths in the .in files; now it appears
to install the demos OK.
