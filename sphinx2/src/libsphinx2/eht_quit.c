 *  quit  --  print message and exit
 *
 *  Usage:  quit (status,format [,arg]...);
 *	int status;
 *	(... format and arg[s] make up a printf-arglist)
 *
 *  Quit is a way to easily print an arbitrary message and exit.
 *  It is most useful for error exits from a program:
 *	if (open (...) < 0) then quit (1,"Can't open...",file);

 * Revision 1.3  2001/12/07 04:27:35  lenzo
 * License cleanup.  Remove conditions on the names.  Rationale: These
 * conditions don't belong in the license itself, but in other fora that
 * offer protection for recognizeable names such as "Carnegie Mellon
 * University" and "Sphinx."  These changes also reduce interoperability
 * issues with other licenses such as the Mozilla Public License and the
 * GPL.  This update changes the top-level license files and removes the
 * old license conditions from each of the files that contained it.
 * All files in this collection fall under the copyright of the top-level
 * LICENSE file.
