This is Sphinx 2, one of Carnegie Mellon University's open source
large vocabulary, speaker-independent continuous speech recognition
engine. Please see the LICENSE file for terms of use.

THIS IS A RESEARCH SYSTEM.  This is also an early release of a
research system.  We know the APIs and function names are likely to
change, and that several tools need to be made available to make this
all complete.  With your help and contributions, this can progress in
response to the needs and patches provided.

Once the system is built, try running sphinx2-test to see if the
system correctly decodes a pre-recorded file.  sphinx2-simple is a
simple script to run the decoder with a set of command line
arguments. The perl script sphinx2-demo is slightly more elaborate,
but you may have to change the bang path to perl at the top.

Please see the web site at

   http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx/ 

for up-to-date information.

sphinx2-test should run sphinx2-batch over an example
utterance of "go forward ten meters" once it's built.
