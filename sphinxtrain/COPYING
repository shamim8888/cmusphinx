From the LAPACK FAQ:

"LAPACK is a freely-available software package. It is available from 
netlib via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web at 
http://www.netlib.org/lapack <http://www.netlib.org/lapack>. Thus, it 
can be included in commercial software packages (and has been). We only 
ask that proper credit be given to the authors.

Like all software, it is copyrighted. It is not trademarked, but we do 
ask the following:

If you modify the source for these routines we ask that you change the 
name of the routine and comment the changes made to the original.

We will gladly answer any questions regarding the software. If a 
modification is done, however, it is the responsibility of the person 
who modified the routine to provide support."
