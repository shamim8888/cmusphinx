Dictionary Information
----------------------

Your project-specific dictionaries go in this folder.

Under normal circumstances the dictionary will be produced as part of
the MakeResources tool chain (from a corpus or from a grammar).

If you have exception pronunciations, these should go in hand.dict.
If you are using the MakeDict tool separately, you should place your
wordlist in this folder (see 'example' for, um, an example).

The noise.dict file is standard for current Sphinx-oriented language
models. You should not need to touch it.
