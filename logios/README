The Logios Tool
----------------
[20070424] (air)

Logios allows you to compile a complete set of knowledge files for use
with a spoken language system based on the Sphinx decoder and the
Phoenix parser.

The current version takes a grammar specification as input and
produces files for decoding and parsing. If you want to start from a
corpus of sentences you should continue to use
http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool.html 

Logios provides a complete language compilation chain. 


Quick Start
-----------

At the same level as Tools, create the following tree:

mkdir Resources/
mkdir Resources/DecoderConfig/Dictionary/
mkdir Resources/DecoderConfig/LanguageModel/
mkdir Resources/Grammar/
mkdir Resources/Grammar/GRAMMAR

This structure follows the one currently in use by the Olympus dialog
system tool. You can modify MakeLanguage/make_language.pl to use your
own scheme.

Copy your grammar and class files into Resources/Grammar/GRAMMAR/
Look in examples/GRAMMAR for a guide

Edit the CompileLanguage.bat file and change the following variables
to reflect your setup:

LOGIOS_ROOT	where the tool is located
RESOURCES	the root of the Resources tree
PROJECT		the root-name of your grammar
INSTANCE	the root-name you want for your generated files

Run: CompileLanguage.bat

Look in Resources for log files.

That's it.
