CFG2NGRAM

This is a tool for the creation of ngram language models from
Context-Free grammars and sparse or no data.

USAGE

Since this tool involved some non-trivial operations, the critial
parts are written in C++ with special attention to efficiency. But
since this is a research platform, a premium is placed on
flexibility. As a result, the toolkit is split up into several pieces,
controlled by an ordinary Make script.

To build a language model copy your grammar file and (if you have one)
your data file into this directory. The grammar file must end in a
.gra extention and the data file must end in a .data extention, and
thier base name must be the same. Then just run

make -f CFG2NGRAM.mak basename.arpa

Where basename is the same as the .gra and .data basenames. The
basename can include directories as well. For example, I have a
grammar file RoomLine.gra, and a data file RoomLine.data, both in a
directory called 'data'. I can run:

make -f CFG2NGRAM.mak data/RoomLine.arpa

It will produce an arpa-formatted language model in the data directory.
