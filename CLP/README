Suggested Steps:
----------------

1) Read README (this file)

2) Read COPYRIGHT (copyright notice; PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!!)

3)(optional) Read some papers (look in the directory PAPERS)

4) Read Description (this is just the beginning of what is supposed to be a description of the system)

5) Read INSTALL and follow the steps there


COMMENT:   There are some comments in the programs but not too many... Maybe in the future I will find more time for adding them.  But hopefully with a good understanding of what the programs are supposed to do (read the papers...) following the flow of actions will be easy...


Thanks to Roberto Gretter for making the programs portable to other compilers (he  dealt with the casting and scoping issues)


Please let me know if YOU have comments  (send them to mangu@us.ibm.com)
