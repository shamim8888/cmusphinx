How to install the programs
==========================

1) gunzip CLP.tar.gz

2) tar xf CLP.tar  

3) cd CLP/src

4) .....change the Make.depend file (change LIBPATH and INCPATH)........

5) make -f Make.depend depend
 
6) make Consensus
  (make Consensus_print)


How to do consensual decoding
=================================

1) cd ../scripts/

2) .....set the values of different parameters in the file 'go.find_consensus.pl'


3) .....You need a file containing the words with their most likely pronunciations and 
        the number of pronunciations (see file data/prons); If you have a pronunciation 
        dictionary in the format <word> <pronunciation>, you can generate the file needed 
        by the program using 'scripts/create_pron_file.pl' 


4) go.find_consensus.pl <latlist> <pronfile> <output_directory> [<print>]
   
        where
		<latlist>           -- list of all the lattices 
                                     
		<pronfile>	    -- the file you created at step 3)
		<output_directory>  -- the directory in which you want the output
		<print>             -- 1 if you want to see the clustering steps; default no printing



RESULT
========

In <output_directory> you will find:

log              -- specifies the values of the parameters used 
                    for generating the output,

consensus.score  -- contains the consensus hypothesis in score format
                    (which can then be scored using NIST scoring programs)

NETWORKS/        -- contains the confusion networks in the FSM
                    text format (this directory will be produced only if you set 
                    the value 1 for the variable $want_networks in go.find_consensus.pl)

Note: take a look in OUT/ to see some examples of how the output looks like
