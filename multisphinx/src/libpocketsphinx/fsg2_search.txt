Rewritten FSG search
--------------------

Basic token passing algorithm:

 * Propagate a null token to the start state:
   * For each outgoing FSG arc:
     * Generate a token marked with this arc
     * Enter the appropriate lextree root with this token
 * For each frame of data
   * Evaluate active HMMs in the lextree
   * For all internal nodes with final states reached:
     * For all children of these nodes:
       * Generate a new token with a backpointer to the exiting token
       * Enter the child nodes (in the usual Viterbi fashion)
   * For all leaf nodes with final states reached:
     * Propagate tokens to target states:
       * For each FSG arc whose first phone matches the right context:
         * Generate a new token with a backpointer to the exiting token
	 * Enter the appropriate lextree roots (matching left diphone)
