* Reduce elastic window size by splitting silences - DONE
* Sort entries before window_sf and track start frames - DONE
* Split fwdtree and fwdflat from ngram_search - DONE
* Give fwdflat its own bptbl - DONE
* Figure out bscorestack problems - DONE (apparently)

* Split bptbl into active and retired
  - Retire bps to separate table
    * Partition the permute array into retired and active indices
    * Switch dest to the retired table in bptbl_compact
    * Do bp remapping in two parts again
  - Retire all remaining bps at end of utterance
  - Pull end frame finding into bptbl
  - Backtraces and lattice gen then refer to the retired portion
  - Test this on standalone fwdtree first

Places where splitting/retiring backpointers might trip us up
 * fake_lmstate - potentially has to crawl a long way back across lots
   of silence/noise words, which might no longer be active.  it should
   be possible to do this incrementally.

* Rewrite lattice generation to be incremental on retired bps
  - No problem with doing this
  - oldest_bp represents the last node which is still generating arcs
  - current code basically does selection sort
  - makes more sense to radix sort them by start frame
    * this is what fwdflat expects
    * radix sort by frame, insertion sort by word id
    * lattice generation is now very, very easy
    * count start frames in retirement process

* Replace bptbl arrays with ring queues
