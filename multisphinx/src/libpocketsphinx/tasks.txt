* Reduce elastic window size by splitting silences - DONE
* Sort entries before window_sf and track start frames - DONE
* Split fwdtree and fwdflat from ngram_search - DONE
* Give fwdflat its own bptbl - DONE
* Figure out bscorestack problems - DONE (apparently)

* Split bptbl into active and retired - DONE (hell yeah)
  - Retire bps to separate table - DONE
    * Partition the permute array into retired and active indices - DONE
    * Switch dest to the retired table in bptbl_compact - DONE
    * Do bp remapping in two parts again - DONE
  - Retire all remaining bps at end of utterance - DONE
  - Pull end frame finding into bptbl - DONE
  - Backtraces and lattice gen then refer to the retired portion - DONE
  - Test this on standalone fwdtree first - DONE

* Implement arc buffers - DONE (mostly)
  - Release old arcs
  - Maybe rewrite bptbl and friends to use the new garray_t
    + This would ease the future transition to circular arrays

* Implement semi-shared acoustic models for search passes - DONE

* Make fwdflat work properly with arc buffer input
  - 

* Rewrite lattice generation to be incremental on retired bps
  - No problem with doing this
  - oldest_bp represents the last node which is still generating arcs
  - current code basically does selection sort
  - makes more sense to radix sort them by start frame
    * this is what fwdflat expects
    * radix sort by frame, insertion sort by word id
    * lattice generation is now very, very easy
    * count start frames in retirement process

* Replace bptbl arrays with ring queues
