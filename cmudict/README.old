*** NOTE: Derivative dictionaries are made and kept in ../lexdata/


This collection contains all major versions of the cmudict.

cmudict.0.6d was the last publicly released version of the
dictionary. It is used in the lmtool service.

cmudict.0.7 was an extension of the 6d version and represented an
additional year or so of development work, however it was never
publicly released. At some point it removed from distribution by the
maintainer. 

cmudict.0.7a and cmudict.0.6e are modifed versions of the above
dictionaries. The modifications are as follows:

1) Entries appearing in both 0.6d and 0.7 that had different
pronunciations were examined and the better version was inserted in
both dictionaries. Notionally this meant taking a corrected entry from
0.7 and putting it into 0.6d.

2) 0.7 was examined for variant errors. Specifically words that had >6
variants had improbably variants removed. (This should be redone
with a lower threshold, say 3).

3) Geminate consonants, typically appearing in compound words, were
collapsed.

4) Certain systematic pronunciation (actually LTS rule) errors were
corrected. (Specifically McXxxx and O'Xxxxx forms.)

5) Serendipitiously discovered errors (encountered in the course of the
above clean-ups) were corrected. 

6) Proper names in the top 10k found in the 1990 US Census and not
appearing in these dictionaries were added.

For modifications 2-6, all changes were propagated to 0.6d.
